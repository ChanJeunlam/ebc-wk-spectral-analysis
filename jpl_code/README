Spectral analysis.

A groundbreaking global ocean and sea ice simulation that represents full-depth ocean
process with an unprecedent degree of realism is used to characterize BMs and IGWs.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology genereal circulation model (MITgcm, Hill et al., 2007) was the heart of the numerical simulation implemented on a latitude/longitude/polar cap (LLC) configuration (Forget et al., 2015). The global simulation was divided in 13 square tiles woth 4,320 grid points on each side (hereinafter called LLC4320).

Identification of the respective impacts of IGWs and BMs on the different fields is based on a spectral analysis in the frequency and wavenumber domains. The LLC4320 simulation has been divided into square boxes with ~6 deg size for the two seasons (January-February-March, JFM; and August-September-October [ASO]). This allows to resolve length scales from 4 to 300 km and periods from 2 hr (hourly outputs were used) to 45 days.

More information about the methodology can be found in the folder named "reference".
Inside the folder a JGR-paper is placed.
Alos, you will find the paper in the next link: https://rdcu.be/bbnGl

Python codes to handle the information are placed in the folder named "programs".

Regarding the files, the names of the files include information about the latitude and longitude
of the central point of the box:
