abstract = {An analysis and physical interpretation of near-inertial waves (NIWs) propagating perpendicular to a steady, two-dimensional, strongly baroclinic, geostrophic current are presented. The analysis is appropriate for geostrophic currents with order-one Richardson numbers such as those associated with fronts experiencing strong, wintertime atmospheric forcing. This work highlights the underlying physics behind the properties of the NIWs using parcel arguments and the principles of conservation of density and absolute momentum. Baroclinicity introduces lateral gradients in density and vertical gradients in absolute momentum that significantly modify the dispersion and polarization relations and propagation of NIWs relative to classical internal wave theory. In particular, oscillations at the minimum frequency are not horizontal but, instead, are slanted along isopycnals. Furthermore, the polarization of the horizontal velocity is not necessarily circular at the minimum frequency and the spiraling of the wave's velocity vector with time and depth can be in the opposite direction from that predicted by classical theory. Ray tracing and numerical solutions illustrate the trapping and amplification of NIWs in regions of strong baroclinicity where the wave frequency is lower than the effective Coriolis frequency. The largest amplification is found at slantwise critical layers that align with the tilted isopycnals of the current. Such slantwise critical layers are seen in wintertime observations of the Gulf Stream and, consistent with the theory, coincide with regions of intensified ageostrophic shear characterized by a banded structure that is spatially coherent along isopycnals.},

abstract = {A new 2° resolution global climatology of the mixed layer depth (MLD) based on individual profiles is constructed. Previous global climatologies have been based on temperature or density-gridded climatologies. The criterion selected is a threshold value of temperature or density from a near-surface value at 10 m depth ($\Delta$T = 0.2°C or $\Delta$$\sigma$$\chi$ = 0.03 kg m-3). A validation of the temperature criterion on moored time series data shows that the method is successful at following the base of the mixed layer. In particular, the first spring restratification is better captured than with a more commonly used larger criteria. In addition, we show that for a given 0.2°C criterion, the MLD estimated from averaged profiles results in a shallow bias of 25{\%} compared to the MLD estimated from individual profiles. A new global seasonal estimation of barrier layer thickness is also provided. An interesting result is the prevalence in mid- and high-latitude winter hemispheres of vertically density-compensated layers, creating an isopycnal but not mixed layer. Consequently, we propose an optimal estimate of MLD based on both temperature and density data. An independent validation of the maximum annual MLD with oxygen data shows that this oxygen estimate may be biased in regions of Ekman pumping or strong biological activity. Significant differences are shown compared to previous climatologies. The timing of the seasonal cycle of the mixed layer is shifted earlier in the year, and the maximum MLD captures finer structures and is shallower. These results are discussed in light of the different approaches and the choice of criterion. Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {A study of the relationship between Lagrangian statistics and flow topology in fluid turbulence is presented. The topology is characterized using the Weiss criterion, which provides a conceptually simple tool to partition the flow into topologically different regions: elliptic (vortex dominated), hyperbolic (deformation dominated), and intermediate (turbulent background). The flow corresponds to forced two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence in doubly periodic and circular bounded domains, the latter with no-slip boundary conditions. In the double periodic domain, the probability density function (pdf) of the Weiss field exhibits a negative skewness consistent with the fact that in periodic domains the flow is dominated by coherent vortex structures. On the other hand, in the circular domain, the elliptic and hyperbolic regions seem to be statistically similar. We follow a Lagrangian approach and obtain the statistics by tracking large ensembles of passively advected tracers. The pdfs of residence time in the topologically different regions are computed introducing the Lagrangian Weiss field, i.e., the Weiss field computed along the particles' trajectories. In elliptic and hyperbolic regions, the pdfs of the residence time have self-similar algebraic decaying tails. In contrast, in the intermediate regions the pdf has exponential decaying tails. The conditional pdfs (with respect to the flow topology) of the Lagrangian velocity exhibit Gaussian-like behavior in the periodic and in the bounded domains. In contrast to the freely decaying turbulence case, the conditional pdfs of the Lagrangian acceleration in forced turbulence show a comparable level of intermittency in both the periodic and the bounded domains. The conditional pdfs of the Lagrangian curvature are characterized, in all cases, by self-similar power-law behavior with a decay exponent of order -2. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Abstract The approximation of geostrophic balance across a front is studied. Making this approximation, an analytic approach is made to a frontogenesis model based on the classic horizontal deformation field. Kelvin's circulation theorem suggests the introduction of a new independent variable in the cross-front direction. The problem is solved exactly for a Boussinesq, uniform potential vorticity fluid. Non-Boussinesq, non-uniform potential vorticity, latent heat, and surface friction effects are all studied. Using a two-region fluid we model the effects of confluence near the tropopause. A similar approach is made to the appearance of fronts in the finite-amplitude development of the simplest Eady wave; this is also solved analytically. Based on the surface fronts produced by these models, we give a general model of a strong surface front. There is a tendency to form discontinuities in a finite time.},

In contrast to prior work, our technique is not restricted to plume detection from spherical bodies, making it relevant for irregularly shaped bodies such as comets. Further, our study analyzes raw data, the form in which it is available on board the spacecraft, rather than fully processed image products. In summary, we contribute a vital assessment of a technique that can be used on board tomorrow's deep space missions to detect, and respond quickly to, new occurrences of plumes and jets.},

abstract = {Submesoscale processes have been extensively studied in observations and simulations of fronts. Recent idealized simulations show that submesoscale instabilities also occur in baroclinic mesoscale cyclones and anticyclones. The instabilities in the anticyclone grow faster and at coarser grid resolution than in the cyclone. The instabilities lead to larger restratification in the anticyclone than in the cyclone. The instabilities also lead to changes in the mean azimuthal jet around the anticyclone from 2-km resolution, but a similar effect only occurs in the cyclone at 0.25-km resolution. A numerical passive tracer experiment shows that submesoscale instabilities lead to deeper subduction in the interior of anticyclonic than cyclonic eddies because of outcropping isopycnals extending deeper into the thermocline in anticyclones. An energetic analysis suggests that both vertical shear production and vertical buoyancy fluxes are important in anticyclones but primarily vertical buoyancy fluxes occur in cyclones at these resolutions. The energy sources and sinks vary azimuthally around the eddies caused by the asymmetric effects of the Ekman buoyancy flux. Glider transects of a mesoscale anticyclone in the Tasman Sea show that water with low stratification and high oxygen concentrations is found in an anticyclone, in a manner that may be consistent with the model predictions for submesoscale subduction in mesoscale eddies.},

By integrating the component wave and turbulence kinetic energy budgets through the turbulent layer, we show that the only mechanism transferring energy between wave and turbulent fields is the work done by the periodic part of the turbulent stress against the wave rate of strain. When these components are $\pi$/2 out of phase, the net energy transfer is zero. Eight wave-turbulence interaction events of differing stability are analyzed and interpreted using rapid distortion theory. When density stratification is approximately steady, the phase relationship does not change from $\pi$/2. However, periodicity in the stratification changes the phase angle and leads to strong energy transfer from wave to turbulence. -Author},

Here, we examine the wind work in a pair of global, very high-resolution (1/48° and 1/24°), MITgcm simulations in Latitude-Longitude-Cap configuration (LLC) that provide hourly output at spatial resolutions of a few kilometers and include tidal forcing. A cospectrum analysis of wind stress and ocean surface currents shows positive contribution at large scales ({\textgreater}300 km) and near-inertial frequency, and negative contribution from mesoscales, tidal frequencies and internal gravity waves (IGWs). Larger surface kinetic energy fluxes are in the Kuroshio in winter at large scales (40 mW m⁻²) and mesoscales (-30 mW m⁻²). The Kerguelen region is dominated by large scale (∼20 mW m⁻²), followed by inertial oscillations in summer (13 mW m⁻²) and mesoscale in winter (-12 mW m⁻²). Kinetic energy fluxes from IGWs (-0.1 to -9.9 mW m⁻²) are generally stronger in summer. Surface kinetic energy fluxes in the LLC simulations are 4.71 TW, which is 25{\%}–85{\%} higher than previous global estimates from coarser (1/6°–1/10°) GCMs; this is likely due to improved representation of wind variability (6-hourly, 0.14°, operational ECMWF). However, the low wind power input to the near-inertial frequency band obtained with LLC (0.16 TW) compared to global slab models suggests that wind variability on time scales less than six hours and spatial scales less than 15 km are critical to better representing the wind power input in ocean circulation models.},

abstract = {The generation and destruction of stratification in the surface mixed layer of the ocean is understood to result from vertical turbulent transport of buoyancy and momentum driven by air-sea fluxes and stresses. In this paper, it is shown that the magnitude and penetration of vertical fluxes are strongly modified by horizontal gradients in buoyancy and momentum. A classic example is the strong restratification resulting from frontogenesis in regions of confluent flow. Frictional forces acting on a baroclinic current either imposed externally by a wind stress or caused by the spindown of the current itself also modify the stratification by driving Ekman flows that differentially advect density. Ekman flow induced during spindown always tends to restratify the fluid, while wind-driven Ekman currents will restratify or destratify the mixed layer if the wind stress has a component up or down front (i.e., directed against or with the geostrophic shear), respectively. Scalings are constructed for the relative importance of friction versus frontogenesis in the restratification of the mixed layer and are tested using numerical experiments of mixed layer fronts forced by both winds and a strain field. The scalings suggest and the numerical experiments confirm that for wind stress magnitudes, mixed layer depths, and cross-front density gradients typical of the ocean, wind-induced friction often dominates frontogenesis in the modification of the stratification of the upper ocean. The experiments reveal that wind-induced destratification is weaker in magnitude than restratification because the stratification generated by up-front winds confines the turbulent stress to a depth shallower than the Ekman layer, which enhances the frictional force, Ekman flow, and differential advection of density. Frictional destratification is further reduced over restratification because the stress associated with the geostrophic shear at the surface tends to compensate a down-front wind stress. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Meteorological Society.},

In this paper, a series of offline-nested numerical simulations is used to study submesoscale flow in theDrake Passage and Scotia Sea regions of the Southern Ocean. These simulations are initialized from an ocean state estimate for late April 2015, with the intent to simulate features observed during the Surface Mixed Layer at Submesoscales (SMILES) research cruise, which occurred at that time and location. The nested models are downscaled from the original state estimate resolution of 1/12° and grid spacing of about 8 km, culminating in a submesoscale-resolving model with a resolution of 1/192° and grid spacing of about 500m. The submesoscale eddy field is found to be highly spatially variable,with pronounced hot spots of submesoscale activity. These areas of high submesoscale activity correspond to a significant difference in the 30-day average mixed layer depth $\Delta$HML between the 1/12° and 1/192° simulations. Regions of large vertical velocities in the mixed layer correspond with high mesoscale strain rather than large $\Delta$HML. It is found that $\Delta$HML is well correlated with the mesoscale density gradient but weakly correlated with both the mesoscale kinetic energy and strain. This has implications for the development of submesoscale eddy parameterizations that are sensitive to the character of the large-scale flow.},

abstract = {The ocean is the largest solar energy collector on Earth. The amount of heat it can store is modulated by its complex circulation, which spans a broad range of spatial scales, from meters to thousands of kilometers. In the classical paradigm, fine oceanic scales, with size less than 20 km, are thought to drive a significant downward heat transport from the surface to the ocean interior, increasing oceanic heat uptake. Here we use a combination of satellite and in situ observations in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to diagnose oceanic vertical heat transport. Results explicitly demonstrate how deep-reaching submesoscale fronts, with a size smaller than 20 km, are generated by mesoscale eddies, with a size of 50-300 km. In contrast with the classical paradigm, these submesoscale fronts are shown to drive an anomalous upward heat transport from the ocean interior back to the surface that is larger than other contributions to vertical heat transport and of comparable magnitude to air-sea fluxes. This effect can remarkably alter oceanic heat uptake and will be strongest in eddy-rich regions such as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the Kuroshio Extension, and the Gulf Stream, all of which are key players in the climate system. Vertical heat transport is one of the key mechanisms by which the ocean regulates Earth's climate. Munk and Wunsch 1 first postulated that vertical heat transport is balanced by an upward component due to the large-scale mean flow ({\textgreater}300 km) and a downward component explained by fine-scale diffusive processes ({\textless}20 km). However, recent studies 2, 3 highlighted the importance of mesoscale eddies (50-300 km) for vertical heat transport. Thus, global vertical heat transport by the mean flow and diffusion are now thought to be both downwards and balanced by an upward eddy heat flux, with the mean and eddy},

In this paper, we show that this approach can favor easy-to-interpret cases that are not necessarily representative of the average behavior of a representation. A more realistic but harder-to-study hypothesis is that semantic representations are distributed, and thus filters must be studied in conjunction. In order to investigate this idea while enabling systematic visualization and quantification of multiple filter responses, we introduce the Net2Vec framework , in which semantic concepts are mapped to vectorial embeddings based on corresponding filter responses. By studying such embeddings, we are able to show that 1., in most cases, multiple filters are required to code for a concept , that 2., often filters are not concept specific and help encode multiple concepts, and that 3., compared to single filter activations, filter embeddings are able to better characterize the meaning of a representation and its relationship to other concepts.},

abstract = {The energy pathways in geostrophic turbulence are explored using a two-layer, flat-bottom, f-plane, quasigeostrophic model forced by an imposed, horizontally homogenous, baroclinically unstable mean flow and damped by bottom Ekman friction. A systematic presentation of the spectral energy fluxes, the mean flow forcing, and dissipation terms allows for a comprehensive understanding of the sources and sinks for baroclinic and barotropic energy as a function of length scale. The key new result is a robust inverse cascade of kinetic energy for both the baroclinic mode and the upper layer. This is consistent with recent observations of satellite altimeter data over the South Pacific Ocean. The well-known forward cascade of baroclinic potential and total energy was found to be very robust. Decomposing the spectral fluxes into contributions from different terms provided further insight. The inverse baroclinic kinetic energy cascade is driven mostly by an efficient interaction between the baroclinic velocity and the barotropic vorticity, the latter playing a crucial catalytic role. This cascade can be further enhanced by the baroclinic mode self-interaction, which is only present with nonuniform stratification (unequal layer depths). When model parameters are set such that modeled eddies compare favorably with observations, the inverse baroclinic kinetic energy cascade is actually much stronger than the well-known inverse cascade in the barotropic mode. The upper-layer kinetic energy cascade was found to dominate the lower-layer cascade over a wide range of parameters, suggesting that the surface cascade and time mean density stratification may be sufficient for estimating the depth-integrated cascade from ocean observations. This may find useful application in inferring the kinetic to gravitational potential energy conversion rate from satellite measurements .},

abstract = {Sea surface height measurements from satellites reveal the turbulent properties of the South Pacific Ocean surface geostrophic circulation, both supporting and challenging different aspects of geostrophic turbulence theory. A near-universal shape of the spectral kinetic energy flux is found and provides direct evidence of a source of kinetic energy near to or smaller than the deformation radius, consistent with linear instability theory. The spectral kinetic energy flux also reveals a net inverse cascade (i.e., a cascade to larger spatial scale), consistent with two-dimensional turbulence phenomenology. However, stratified geostrophic turbulence theory predicts an inverse cascade for the barotropic mode only; energy in the large-scale baroclinic modes undergoes a direct cascade toward the first-mode deformation scale. Thus if the surface geostrophic flow is predominately the first baroclinic mode, as expected for oceanic stratification profiles, then the observed inverse cascade contradicts geostrophic turbulence theory. The latter interpretation is argued for. Furthermore, and consistent with this interpretation, the inverse cascade arrest scale does not follow the Rhines arrest scale, as one would expect for the barotropic mode. A tentative revision of theory is proposed that would resolve the conflicts; however, further observations and idealized modeling experiments are needed to confirm, or refute, the revision. It is noted that no inertial range was found for the inverse cascade range of the spectrum, implying inertial range scaling, such as the established K 5/3 slope in the spectral kinetic energy density plot, is not applicable to the surface geostrophic flow.},

The solution is highly baroclinic and reveals a global field of internal waves radiating way from generation sites of rough topography. A small number of sites where intense internal wave generation occurs accounts for most of the globally integrated work done on the barotropic tide and dominates sites such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge. The globally integrated conversion of the M2 barotropic tide is 891 Gigawatts and the globally integrated rate of working of the ocean by astronomical forcing is 2.94 Terawatts. Both of these estimates are close to accepted values derived from independent methods. Regional estimates of conversion are also similar to previous inferences, lending additional confidence that the solution has captured the essential physics of low-mode internal wave generation and that numerical prediction of conversion has skill in regions where no previous estimates are available. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The question of how kinetic energy (KE) is dissipated in the ocean remains a key question in physical oceanography. Recent literature suggests that quasi-balanced submesoscale motions and internal gravity waves (IGWs) can play an active role in fluxing kinetic energy towards dissipative scales. The process and mechanisms by which these classes of motions may provide a route to dissipation remain as open questions. In this study, we investigate the impact of internal tides generated by tidal motions on cross-scale kinetic energy exchanges at midlatitude. Our analysis is based on the output of two NEMO based sub-mesoscale permitting ocean model simulations of the North Atlantic ocean (with/without tidal forcing). Our results show that resolving both submesoscales and IGWs yields a strong forward cascade toward dissipative scales. But we find that different mechanisms are controlling this forward cascade depending on the season. In wintertime, energetic submesoscales are the key driver for the forward cascade of KE while in summertime IGWs are responsible for the forward cascade. We found that, in both seasons, the forward cascade at high wavenumbers extends vertically over a significant fraction of the upper ocean.},

These contribute significantly to energy dissipation, tracer mixing, and exchanges between the ocean surface layer, the ocean interior, and the atmospheric boundary layer. Internal waves and submesoscale motions both undergo strong spatial and seasonal variations, driven by different mechanisms. Here, we investigate the sea surface signature of internal waves and its seasonality using linear wave theory and a high‐resolution realistic simulation. In summer, internal waves are greatly amplified near the surface mostly due to a thin mixed layer bounded by a seasonal pycnocline. This surface amplification is well captured by linear theory, provided that the stratification at the base of the mixed layer is accurately represented. In winter, the superinertial motions are not fully explained by linear theory, reflecting impacts of the more energetic submesoscale motions.},

The subsurface field is augmented by the addition of the barotropic and first baroclinic modes, whose amplitudes are determined by matching to the sea surface height (pressure), after subtracting the SQG contribution. An additional constraint is that the bottom pressure anomaly vanishes. The method is tested for three regions in the North Atlantic using data from a high-resolution numerical simulation.

This unique transport property is not captured in climate models that have insufficient resolution to simulate these submesoscale dynamics. Here, we use an ocean model with an unprecedented resolution that, for the first time, globally resolves submesoscale heat transport. Upper-ocean submesoscale turbulence produces a systematically-upward heat transport that is five times larger than mesoscale heat transport, with winter-time averages up to 100 W/m2 for mid-latitudes. Compared to a lower-resolution model, submesoscale heat transport warms the sea surface up to 0.3 °C and produces an upward annual-mean air–sea heat flux anomaly of 4–10 W/m2 at mid-latitudes. These results indicate that submesoscale dynamics are critical to the transport of heat between the ocean interior and the atmosphere, and are thus a key component of the Earth's climate.},

abstract = {Horizontal resolutions of regional ocean models are often inadequate to resolve submesoscale vertical advection (SVA) in the continental shelf seas. This study aims to compare the SVA in two similar model setups in the East China Sea with different horizontal resolutions. A novel method to parameterise the impact of SVA on temperature (SVA-T) has also been proposed, which can significantly improve the low-resolution model (LRM) results. In particular, we focus on the time frame wherein this method can be applied. The suggested method primarily improves the representation of an internal warming process, which is significant in both the observations and high-resolution model (HRM) but is absent in the original LRM. Combined with the observations, we found that the internal warming, which occurred in the barrier layer of the water column during early autumn, is accompanied by submesoscale oscillations of isothermals in the HRM. SVA dominates the internal warming process and increases the total vertical advection by up to an order of magnitude in the HRM compared with the LRM. Therefore, we parameterised SVA-T by increasing the vertical thermal diffusion coefficient in the LRM. To further specify the time frame wherein the parameterisation can be applied, we introduced two empirical conditions related to the major generation mechanisms of frontogenesis, mixed-layer instabilities and turbulent thermal wind in the mixed layer: a deep mixed-layer depth {\textgreater}20 m and a large surface-bottom temperature difference (∆T {\textgreater}2 °C). Finally, we successfully simulated the internal warming in the LRM during early autumn by applying the proposed method. Nevertheless, the parameterisation of the horizontal distribution of SVA-T needs to be considered in the future to achieve better three-dimensional model results.},

The emergent upper-ocean submesoscale fronts are analyzed from phenomenological and dynamical perspectives, using a combination of composite averaging and separation of distinctive subregions of the flow. The initiating dynamical process for the transition is near-surface frontogenesis. The frontal behavior is similar to both observed meteorological surface fronts and solutions of the approximate dynamical model called surface dynamics (i.e., uniform interior potential vorticity q and diagnostic force balance) in the intensification of surface density gradients and secondary circulations in response to a mesoscale strain field. However, there are significant behavioral differences compared to the surface-dynamics model. Wind stress acts on fronts through nonlinear Ekman transport and creation and destruction of potential vorticity. The strain-induced frontogenesis is disrupted by vigorous submesoscale frontal instabilities that in turn lead to secondary frontogenesis events, submesoscale vortices, and excitation of even smaller-scale flows. Intermittent, submesoscale breakdown of geostrophic and gradient-wind force balance occurs during the intense frontogenesis and frontal-instability events. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Meteorological Society. A submesoscale filament of dense water in the oceanic surface layer can undergo frontogenesis with a secondary circulation that has a surface horizontal convergence and downwelling in its center. This occurs either because of the mesoscale straining deformation or because of the surface boundary layer turbulence that causes vertical eddy momentum flux divergence or, more briefly, vertical momentum mixing. In the latter case the circulation approximately has a linear horizontal momentum balance among the baroclinic pressure gradient, Coriolis force, and vertical momentum mixing, that is, a turbulent thermal wind. The frontogenetic evolution induced by the turbulent mixing sharpens the transverse gradient of the longitudinal velocity (i.e., it increases the vertical vorticity) through convergent advection by the secondary circulation. In an approximate model based on the turbulent thermal wind, the central vorticity approaches a finite-time singularity, and in a more general hydrostatic model, the central vorticity and horizontal convergence are amplified by shrinking the transverse scale to near the model's resolution limit within a short advective period on the order of a day.},

abstract = {Numerical and analytical models are developed to discuss large-scale, low-frequency, wind-driven fluctuations over the continental shelf and slope in the presence of realistic density stratification and bottom friction. The models employ the “long-wave” assumption that frequencies are small relative to the inertial frequency and that alongshore scales are large relative to cross cross-shelf scales. An attempt is made to make the effect of bottom friction on the flow as realistic as possible by taking into account the influence of surface gravity waves on bottom stress. The results were obtained for sinusoidal wind forcing having frequency $\omega$ and alongshore wavenumber l and are described below. A general criterion for barotropic shelf water response for wind forcing frequencies $\omega$ in the “weather” band (2$\pi$/few weeks to 2$\pi$/few days) can be derived. For the purpose of rapid calculation, this criterion reduces, approximately, tohere Ns2 is a shelf-averaged value of the buoyancy frequency squared, $\alpha$ is an averaged shelf bottom slope and f is the Coriolis parameter. The criterion implies that shelf waters respond barotropically on non-narrow nonequatorial shelves. Under the more restrictive condition Ns2$\alpha$f−1 ≪ 1, analysis shows that the shelf edge pressure is zero and essentially all the wind-driven fluctuating flow occurs on the shelf. Bottom-stress enhancement due to surface gravity waves can significantly affect the low-frequency, large-scale flow. As an indication of how the numerical model can be used to determine the stratified frictional shelf and slope water response, calculations were performed for the CODE (Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment) region. We found that currents were usually strongest nearshore with a monotonic decrease in amplitude offshore and no zero-crossings. Current amplitudes tended to decrease with depth, particularly over the slope. Nearshore fluctuations generally led those farther offshore in time. For A dyn cm−2 wind stress forcing, typical alongshore current velocity amplitudes decreased from about 15–25 cm s−1 nearshore to 1–15 cm s−1 at the shelf edge.},

The phenomena most affected by the TA include mesoscale flows (Ekman spirals, deep convection, and equatorial jets) and internal waves. Abandoning the TA produces a tilt in convective plumes, produces a dependence on wind direction in Ekman spirals, and gives rise to a plethora of changes in internal wave behavior in weakly stratified layers, such as the existence of trapped short low-frequency waves, and a poleward extension of their habitat. In the astrophysical context of stars and gas giant planets, the TA affects the rate of tidal dissipation and also the patterns of thermal convection.

Nonetheless, research involving a robust analysis of the Sentinel-2 bands for supporting agricultural applications is limited. We evaluated the potential of Sentinel-2 data for retrieving winter wheat LAI, leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC). In coordination with destructive and non-destructive ground measurements, we acquired multispectral data from a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-mounted sensor measuring key Sentinel-2 spectral bands (443 to 865 nm). We applied Gaussian processes regression (GPR) machine learning to determine the most informative Sentinel-2 bands for retrieving each of the variables. We further evaluated the GPR model performance when propagating observation uncertainty. When applying the best-performing GPR models without propagating uncertainty, the retrievals had a high agreement with ground measurements—the mean R2 and normalised root-mean-square error (NRMSE) were 0.89 and 8.8{\%}, respectively. When propagating uncertainty, the mean R2 and NRMSE were 0.82 and 11.9{\%}, respectively. When accounting for measurement uncertainty in the estimation of LAI and CCC, the number of most informative Sentinel-2 bands was reduced from four to only two—the red-edge (705 nm) and near-infrared (865 nm) bands. This research demonstrates the value of the Sentinel-2 spectral characteristics for retrieving critical variables that can support more sustainable crop management practices.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Royal Meteorological Society A two-dimensional regime diagram for geostrophic turbulence in the ocean is constructed by plotting observation-based estimates of the non-dimensional eddy length-scale against a nonlinearity parameter equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square eddy velocity and baroclinic Rossby phase speed. Two estimates of the eddy length-scale are compared: the equivalent eddy radius inferred from the area enclosed by contours of sea-surface height, and the ‘unsuppressed' mixing length, based on an estimate of the eddy diffusivity with mean flow effects removed. For weak nonlinearity, as found in the Tropics, the mixing length mostly corresponds to the stability threshold for baroclinic instability whereas the eddy radius corresponds to the Rhines scale; it is suggested that this mismatch is indicative of the inverse energy cascade that occurs at low latitudes in the ocean and the zonal elongation of eddies. At larger values of nonlinearity, as found at mid- and high latitudes, the eddy length-scales are much shorter than the stability threshold, within a factor of 2.5 of the Rossby deformation radius.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Meteorological Society. Low-frequency variability at the ocean surface can be excited both by atmospheric forcing, such as in exchanges of heat and momentum, and by the intrinsic nonlinear transfer of energy between mesoscale ocean eddies. Recent studies have shown that nonlinear eddy interactions can excite an energy transfer from high to low frequencies analogous to the transfer of energy from high to low wavenumbers (small to large spatial scales) in quasi-two-dimensional turbulence. As the spatial inverse cascade is driven by oceanic eddies, the process of energy exchange across frequencies may be sensitive to ocean model resolution. Here a cross-spectrum diagnostic is applied to the oceanic component in a hierarchy of fully coupled ocean-atmosphere models to address the transfer of ocean surface kinetic energy between high and low frequencies. The cross-spectral diagnostic allows for a comparison of the relative contributions of coupled atmospheric forcing through wind stress and the intrinsic advection to low-frequency ocean surface kinetic energy. Diagnostics of energy flux and transfer within the frequency domain are compared between three coupled models with ocean model horizontal resolutions of 1°, 1/4°, and 1/10° to address the importance of resolving eddies in the driving of energy to low frequencies in coupled models.},

The current version (Version 4.1, http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/GHGMR-4FJ04) features the 1-km resolution MODIS retrievals, which are fused with AVHRR GAC, microwave, and in-situ SST data by applying internal correction for relative biases among the data sets. Only the night-time (dusk to dawn locally) satellite SST retrievals are used to estimate the foundation SST. The MUR SST values agree with the GHRSST Multi-Product Ensemble (GMPE) SST field to 0.36°C on average, except in summer-time Arctic region where the existing SST analysis products are known to disagree with each other. The feature resolution of the MUR SST analysis is an order of magnitude higher than most existing analysis products. The Multi-Resolution Variational Analysis (MRVA) method allows the MUR analysis to use multiple synoptic time scales, including a 5-day data window used for reconstruction of mesoscale features and data windows of only few hours for the smaller scale features. Reconstruction of fast evolving small scale features and interpolation over persistent large data voids can be achieved simultaneously by the use of multiple synoptic windows in the multi-scale setting. The MRVA method is also a “mesh-less” interpolation procedure that avoids truncation of the geolocation data during gridding and binning of satellite samples. Future improvements of the MUR SST analysis will include ingestion of day-time MODIS retrievals as well as more recent high-resolution SST retrievals from VIIRS.},

abstract = {The upwelling system off Peru/Chile is characterized by significant mesoscale to submesoscale surface variability that results from the instability of the coastal currents (due to the strong vertical and horizontal shears) and to the marked density cross-shore gradients (associated with the mean upwelling). Here we investigate to what extent upwelling intensity can be inferred from sea surface tem- perature (SST) derived from remote sensing. As a first step in validation, a comparison between SST observations is performed, which indicates that the 1 km gridded multi-scale ultra-high-resolu- tion (MUR) SST data set is defining a zone of maximum SST gradi- ents closer to shore than the low-resolution National Centers for Environmental Information 0.25° resolution data set. Two model versions, at nominal resolutions of 2 km and 4 km, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model are analysed. A high-resolution version at 2 km is examined for the period 13 September 2011–23 January 2013, while a 4 km version is examined for 6 March 2011–22 April 2013. MUR shows maxima SST gradients in the range of 0.03 ± 0.02 K km−1 while the model showed higher gradients around 0.05 ± 0.02 K km−1. Based on coherence spectra, the relationship between upwelling rate (as inferred from the vertical velocity) and SST gradient is documented in the model from intraseasonal to annual timescales. It suggests that changes in SST gradient magnitudes are related to changes in the intensity of coastal upwelling off Peru and Chile. Such a relation- ship between SST gradients and vertical velocity would allow for the use of satellite-derived SSTs to monitor the intensity of coastal upwelling from the intraseasonal to annual timescales.},

We examine the temporal means and variability of the semidiurnal internal tide energy fluxes in 1/25° global simulations of the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and in a global archive of 79 historical moorings. Low-frequency flows, a major cause of internal tide variability, have comparable kinetic energies at the mooring sites in model and observations. The computed root-mean-square (RMS) variability of the energy flux is large in both model and observations and correlates positively with the time-averaged flux magnitude. Outside of strong generation regions, the normalized RMS variability (the RMS variability divided by the mean) is nearly independent of the flux magnitudes in the model, and of order 23{\%} or more in both the model and observations. The spatially averaged flux magnitudes in observations and the simulation agree to within a factor of about 1.4 and 2.4 for vertical mode-1 and mode-2, respectively. The difference in energy flux computed from the full-depth model output versus model output subsampled at mooring instrument depths is small. The global historical archive is supplemented with six high-vertical resolution moorings from the Internal Waves Across the Pacific (IWAP) experiment. The model fluxes agree more closely with the high-resolution IWAP fluxes than with the historical mooring fluxes. The high variability in internal tide energy fluxes implies that internal tide fluxes computed from short observational records should be regarded as realizations of a highly variable field, not as “means” that are indicative of conditions at the measurement sites over all time.},

abstract = {Evidence is presented for the transfer of energy from low-frequency inertial–diurnal internal waves to high-frequency waves in the band between 6 cpd and the buoyancy frequency. This transfer links the most energetic waves in the spectrum, those receiving energy directly from the winds, barotropic tides, and parametric subharmonic instability, with those most directly involved in the breaking process. Transfer estimates are based on month-long records of ocean velocity and temperature obtained continuously over 80–800 m from the research platform (R/P) Floating Instrument Platform (FLIP) in the Hawaii Ocean Mixing Experiment (HOME) Nearfield (2002) and Farfield (2001) experiments, in Hawaiian waters. Triple correlations between low-frequency vertical shears and high-frequency Reynolds stresses, hu i w›U i /›zi, are used to estimate energy transfers. These are supported by bispectral analysis, which show significant energy transfers to pairs of waves with nearly identical frequency. Wavenumber bispectra indicate that the vertical scales of the high-frequency waves are unequal, with one wave of comparable scale to that of the low-frequency parent and the other of much longer scale. The scales of the high-frequency waves contrast with the classical pictures of induced diffusion and elastic scattering interactions and violates the scale-separation assumption of eikonal models of interaction. The possibility that the observed waves are Doppler shifted from intrinsic frequencies near f or N is explored. Peak transfer rates in the Nearfield, an energetic tidal conversion site, are on the order of 2 3 10 27 W kg 21 and are of similar magnitude to estimates of turbulent dissipation that were made near the ridge during HOME. Transfer rates in the Farfield are found to be about half the Nearfield values.},

abstract = {Bispectral analysis of the numerically reproduced spectral responses of the two-dimensional oceanic internal wave field to the incidence of the low-mode semidiurnal internal tide is performed. At latitudes just equatorward of 30 degrees, the low-mode semidiurnal internal tide dominantly interacts with two high-vertical-wavenumber diurnal ( near inertial) internal waves, forming resonant triads of parametric subharmonic instability (PSI) type. As the high-vertical-wavenumber near-inertial energy level is raised by this interaction, the energy cascade to small horizontal and vertical scales is enhanced. Bispectral analysis thus indicates that energy in the low-mode semidiurnal internal tide is not directly transferred to small scales but via the development of high-vertical-wavenumber near-inertial current shear. In contrast, no noticeable energy cascade to high vertical wavenumbers is recognized in the bispectra poleward of similar to 30 degrees as well as equatorward of similar to 25 degrees. A new finding is that, although PSI is possible equatorward of similar to 30 degrees, the efficiency drops sharply as the latitude falls below similar to 25 degrees. At all latitudes, another resonant interaction suggestive of induced diffusion is found to occur between the low-mode semidiurnal internal tide and two high-frequency internal waves, although bispectral analysis shows that this interaction plays only a minor role in cascading the low-mode semidiurnal internal tide energy.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Meteorological Society. The nonlinear dynamics leading to the generation of superinertial internal waves in the ocean, in the wake of a cyclonic storm, is investigated by means of theoretical arguments and of numerical integration of the hydrostatic Boussinesq equations in a simplified, realistic, open-ocean setting. The velocity fields are first decomposed into internal baroclinic modes, and then the energy transfer across modes and at different frequencies is calculated analytically. The energy transfer across modes is dominated by the advection of high-mode m waves by the second- and third-mode waves (n = 2 or 3), which are the most energetic, and this results in the excitation of the l = m - 2 or m - 3 mode wave at the double-inertial frequency. The analyzed nonlinear interactions lead to a transfer of energy from near-inertial waves, directly excited by the storm, to superinertial waves, which typically propagate faster and farther than their lower-frequency parents and can lead to internal mixing even at large distances from the region of large air-sea momentum fluxes. Energy is found to flow from large to small scales as well. Thus, the double-inertial peak formation is thought to represent a small but fundamental intermediate step in the energy cascade toward dissipation.},

abstract = {The ocean circulation is a cause and consequence of fluid scale interactions ranging from millimeters to more than 10,000 km. Although the wind field produces a large energy input to the ocean, all but approximately 10{\%} appears to be dissipated within about 100 m of the sea surface, rendering observations of the energy divergence necessary to maintain the full watercolumn flow difficult. Attention thus shifts to the physically different kinetic energy (KE) reservoirs of the circulation and their maintenance, dissipation, and possible influence on the very small scales representing irreversible molecular mixing. Oceanic KE is dominated by the geostrophic eddy field, and depending on the vertical structure (barotropic versus low-mode baroclinic), direct and inverse energy cascades are possible. The pathways toward dissipation of the dominant geostrophic eddy KE depend crucially on the direction of the cascade but are difficult to quantify because of serious observational difficulties for wavelengths shorter than approximately 100-200 km. At high frequencies, KE is dominated by internal waves with near-inertial frequencies (frequencies near the local Coriolis parameter), whose shears appear to be a major source of wave breaking and mixing in the ocean interior.

@article{Arbic2007,
abstract = {Analysis of spectral kinetic energy fluxes in satellite altimetry data has demonstrated that an inverse cascade of kinetic energy is ubiquitous in the ocean. In geostrophic turbulence models, a fully developed inverse cascade results in barotropic eddies with large horizontal scales. However, midocean eddies contain substantial energy in the baroclinic mode and in compact horizontal scales (scales comparable to the deformation radius Ld). This paper examines the possibility that relatively strong bottom friction prevents the oceanic cascade from becoming fully developed. The importance of the vertical structure of friction is demonstrated by contrasting numerical simulations of two-layer quasigeostrophic turbulence forced by a baroclinically unstable mean flow and damped by bottom Ekman friction with turbulence damped by vertically symmetric Ekman friction (equal decay rates in the two layers). “Cascade inequalities” derived from the energy and enstrophy equations are used to interpret the numerical results. In the symmetric system, the inequality formally requires a cascade to large-scale barotropic flow, independent of the strati- fication. The inequality is less strict when friction is in the bottom layer only, especially when stratification is surface intensified. Accordingly, model runs with surface-intensified stratification and relatively strong bottom friction retain substantial small-scale baroclinic energy. Altimetric data show that the symmetric inequality is violated in the low- and midlatitude ocean, again suggesting the potential impact of the “bottomness” of friction on eddies. Inequalities developed for multilayer turbulence suggest that high baroclinic modes in the mean shear also enhance small-scale baroclinic eddy energy. The inequalities motivate a new interpretation of barotropization in weakly damped turbulence. In that limit the barotropic mode dominates the spatial average of kinetic energy density because large values of barotropic density are found throughout the model domain, consistent with the barotropic cascade to large horizontal scales, while baroclinic density is spatially localized.},

abstract = {Motivated by the potential of oceanic mesoscale eddies to drive intrinsic low-frequency variability, this paper examines geostrophic turbulence in the frequency-wavenumber domain. Frequency-wavenumber spectra, spectral fluxes, and spectral transfers are computed from an idealized two-layer quasi-geostrophic (QG) turbulence model, a realistic high-resolution global ocean general circulation model, and gridded satellite altimeter products. In the idealized QG model, energy in low wavenumbers, arising from nonlinear interactions via the well-known inverse cascade, is associated with energy in low frequencies, and vice versa, although not in a simple way. The range of frequencies that are highly energized and engaged in nonlinear transfer is much greater than the range of highly energized and engaged wavenumbers. Low-frequency, low-wavenumber energy is maintained primarily by nonlinearities in the QG model, with forcing and friction playing important but secondary roles. In the high resolution ocean model, nonlinearities also generally drive kinetic energy to low frequencies as well as to low wavenumbers. Implications for the maintenance of low-frequency oceanic variability are discussed. The cascade of surface kinetic energy to low frequencies which predominates in idealized and realistic models is seen in some regions of the gridded altimeter product, but not in others. Exercises conducted with the general circulation model suggest that the spatial and temporal filtering inherent in the construction of gridded satellite altimeter maps may contribute to the discrepancies seen in some regions between the direction of frequency cascade in models versus gridded altimeter maps. Of course, another potential reason for the discrepancy is missing physics in the models utilized here.},

The frequency spectra of the variance of streamfunction (akin to sea 2 surface height) and of geostrophic velocity are qualitatively similar in all of these, with sub- 3 stantial variance extending out to low frequencies. The spectral flux $\Pi$($\omega$) of kinetic energy in the frequency ($\omega$) domain for the QG model documents a tendency for nonlinearity to 3 drive energy towards longer periods, in like manner to the inverse cascade towards larger length scales documented in calculations of the spectral flux $\Pi$(k) in the wavenumber (k) 3 domain. Computations of $\Pi$($\omega$) in the realistic model also display an “inverse temporal 3 cascade”. In satellite altimeter data, some regions are dominated by an inverse temporal 3 cascade, while others exhibit a forward temporal cascade. However, calculations performed 37 with temporally- and/or spatially-filtered output from the models demonstrate that $\Pi$($\omega$) 3 values are highly susceptible to the smoothing inherent in the construction of gridded al- 3 timeter products. Therefore at present it is difficult to say whether the forward temporal 4 cascades seen in some regions in altimeter data represent physics which is missing in the 41 models studied here, or merely sampling artifacts. 23 4 5 6 7 28 9 0 31 2 33 4 5 6 8 9 0 2},

A detailed description of the conservation laws of this vertical-plane-wave model illuminates the mechanism of stimulated generation associated with vertical vorticity and lateral strain. There are two sources of wave potential energy, and corresponding sinks of balanced kinetic energy: the refractive convergence of wave action density into anti-cyclones (and divergence from cyclones); and the enhancement of wave-field gradients by geostrophic straining. We quantify these energy transfers and describe the phenomenology of stimulated generation using numerical solutions of an initially uniform inertial oscillation interacting with mature freely evolving two-dimensional turbulence. In all solutions, stimulated generation co-exists with a transfer of balanced kinetic energy to large scales via vortex merging. Also, geostrophic straining accounts for most of the generation of wave potential energy, representing a sink of 10 {\%}–20 {\%} of the initial balanced kinetic energy. However, refraction is fundamental because it creates the initial eddy-scale lateral gradients in the near-inertial field that are then enhanced by advection. In these quasi-inviscid solutions, wave dispersion is the only mechanism that upsets stimulated generation: with a barotropic balanced flow, lateral straining enhances the wave group velocity, so that waves accelerate and rapidly escape from straining regions. This wave escape prevents wave energy from cascading to dissipative scales.},

In the absence of high-frequency atmospheric forcing, the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and subpolar gyres was found to decrease by 25{\%}. In the Labrador Sea, the eddy kinetic energy decreased by 75{\%} and the average maximum mixed layer depth decreased by between 20{\%} and 110{\%} depending on the climatology. In particular, high-frequency forcing was found to have a greater impact on mixed layer deepening in moderate to warm years whereas in relatively cold years the temperatures alone were enough to facilitate deep convection. Additional simulations in which either the wind or temperature was filtered revealed that the wind, through its impact on the bulk formulas for latent and sensible heat, had a greater impact on deep convection than the temperature.},

abstract = {In the ocean, wind-generated kinetic energy (KE) manifests itself primarily in balanced currents and near-inertial waves. The dynamics of these flows is strongly constrained by the Earth's rotation, causing the KE in balanced currents to follow an inverse cascade but also preventing wave-wave interactions from fluxing energy in the near-inertial band to lower frequencies and higher vertical wavenumbers. How wind-generated KE is transferred to small-scale turbulence and dissipated is thus a non-trivial problem. This article presents a review of recent theoretical calculations and numerical simulations that demonstrate how some surprising modifications to internal wave physics by the lateral density gradients present at ocean fronts allow for strong interactions between balanced currents and near-inertial waves that ultimately result in energy loss for both types of motion.},

abstract = {The future international Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Mission, planned for launch in 2021, will make high-resolution 2D observations of sea-surface height using SAR radar interferometric techniques. SWOT will map the global and coastal oceans up to 77.6° latitude every 21 days over a swath of 120 km (20 km nadir gap). Today's 2D mapped altimeter data can resolve ocean scales of 150 km wavelength whereas the SWOT measurement will extend our 2D observations down to 15-30 km, depending on sea state. SWOT will offer new opportunities to observe the oceanic dynamic processes at these scales, that are important in the generation and dissipation of kinetic energy in the ocean, and act as one of the main gateways connecting the interior of the ocean to the upper layer. The active vertical exchanges linked to these scales have impacts on the local and global budgets of heat and carbon, and on nutrients for biogeochemical cycles. This review paper highlights the issues being addressed by the SWOT science community to understand SWOT's very precise SSH / surface pressure observations, and it explores how SWOT data will be combined with other satellite and in-situ data and models to better understand the upper ocean 4D circulation (x,y,z,t) over the next decade. SWOT's new SAR-interferometry technology aims to observe ocean SSH scales down to 15-30 km in wavelength. At these scales, SSH includes “balanced” geostrophic eddy motions and high-frequency internal tides and internal waves. This presents both a challenge in reconstructing the 4D upper ocean circulation, or in the assimilation of SSH in models, but also an opportunity to have global observations of the 2D structure of these phenomena, and to learn more about their interactions. At these small scales, the ocean dynamics evolve rapidly, and combining SWOT 2D SSH data with other satellite or in-situ data with different space-time coverage is also a challenge. SWOT's new technology will be a forerunner for the future altimetric observing system, and so advancing on these issues today will pave the way for our future.},

To address this issue, we develop a Distillation Guided Routing method, which is a flexible framework to interpret a deep neural network by identifying critical data routing paths and analyzing the functional processing be-havior of the corresponding layers. Specifically, we propose to discover the critical nodes on the data routing paths dur-ing network inferring prediction for individual input sam-ples by learning associated control gates for each layer's output channel. The routing paths can, therefore, be repre-sented based on the responses of concatenated control gates from all the layers, which reflect the network's semantic se-lectivity regarding to the input patterns and more detailed functional process across different layer levels. Based on the discoveries, we propose an adversarial sample detection algorithm by learning a classifier to discriminate whether the critical data routing paths are from real or adversar-ial samples. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively achieve high defense rate with minor train-ing overhead.},

In the limit of a vanishing coastal wall, topographic Rossby waves are the only class of sub-inertial frequency, trapped wave motion. The stratification effect on topographic Rossby waves depends on both the local baroclinic radius of deformation and the characteristic offshore length scale of the wave motion. For intermediate density stratification, long waves are nearly depth-independent in the shelf region, and are bottom-trapped in the slope region. The topographic Rossby waves reduce to the barotropic shelf waves and the bottom-trapped waves in the limits of small and large density stratification, respectively.

This study examines the poleward undercurrent and alongshore pressure gradients in the northern California Current System (CCS), where local wind stress forcing is relatively weak. The dynamics of the undercurrent are compared in the primitive equation Navy Coastal Ocean Model and a linear coastal trapped wave model. Both models are validated using hydrographic data and current-meter observations in the core of the undercurrent in the northern CCS. In the linear model, variability in the predominantly equatorward wind stress along the U.S. West Coast produces episodic reversals to poleward flow over the northern CCS slope during summer. However, reproducing the persistence of the undercurrent during late summer requires additional incoming energy from sea level variability applied south of the region of the strongest wind forcing. The relative importance of the barotropic and baroclinic components of the modeled alongshore pressure gradient changes with latitude. In contrast to the southern and central portions of the CCS, the baroclinic component of the alongshore pressure gradient provides the primary poleward force at CUC depths over the northern CCS slope. At time scales from weeks to months, the alongshore pressure gradient force is primarily balanced by the Coriolis force associated with onshore flow. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

We focus on the equatorially-forced fast and weakly dissipative first-mode coastal trapped waves which are shown to propagate down to the southern tip of Africa. In the eastern equatorial Atlantic, the first-mode equatorial forcing is tangled with the higher-order Kelvin wave modes and is overshadowed by the dominant second baroclinic mode. The latter is slower and peaks 10 days after the concealed first-mode contribution. Within this time frame, the remotely-forced first-mode coastal trapped waves impinge on the variability of the Benguela upwelling ecosystem, almost in phase with the subseasonal sea level fluctuations in the Gulf of Guinea. Over 1993–2008, the equatorial forcing undergoes a substantial interannual modulation. Periods of energetic first-mode equatorial Kelvin waves coincide with a strong subseasonal coastal wind activity that breaks the stronger equatorial connection. This suggests the existence of a large-scale atmospheric connection between the equatorial wave forcing and the along-shore winds in the Benguela, modulating the maximum latitude at which the equatorial dynamics impacts the local marine resources.},

Subsurface pressure (SsP) observations from stations inside and outside of the Gulf of California (GC) are used to analyze the relationship between low-frequency currents, temperature, and transport inside the GC and intraseasonal coastal-trapped waves (CTWs), which propagate poleward along the coast toward the GC. Correlation functions and coherences of SsP stations were consistent with intraseasonal CTWs splitting in two at the mouth of the gulf: one part enters the gulf, propagates around the gulf, and eventually, toward the mouth, and another part that appears to “jump” the mouth of the gulf and travels poleward along the west coast of the peninsula. The correlation and coherence estimates of SsP at Manzanillo with currents showed that downwelling CTWs generated along-gulf current anomalies toward the head of the gulf at the mainland shelf of the mouth, whereas at Ballenas Channel sill (San Lorenzo sill) these waves generated current anomalies toward the mouth near the surface (bottom). At the San Lorenzo (SL) sill, downwelling CTWs increased the near-bottom ({\~{}}400 m) temperature and reduced the bottom transport of deep, fresher, and colder water that flows toward the head of the gulf. Cross-Calibrated Multiplatform winds were used to investigate their relationship with currents. The first empirical orthogonal function of the along-gulf wind stress showed that wind blowing toward the head of the gulf generated a reduction of bottom transport toward the head of the gulf through the SL sill, and intensified surface geostrophic current fluctuations toward the head of the gulf. There was also significant correlation between inflow bottom transport and outflow surface geostrophic velocities averaged across the gulf, consistent with the exchange pattern for the Northern Gulf.},

abstract = {Vertical profiles of horizontal velocity obtained during the Mid-Ocean Dynamics Experiment (MODE) provided the first published estimates of the high vertical wavenumber structure of horizontal velocity. The data were interpreted as being representative of the background internal wave field, and thus, despite some evidence of excess downward energy propagation associated with coherent near-inertial features that was interpreted in terms of atmospheric generation, these data provided the basis for a revision to the Garrett and Munk spectral model. These data are reinterpreted through the lens of 30 years of research. Rather than representing the background wave field, atmospheric generation, or even near-inertial wave trapping, the coherent high wavenumber features are characteristic of internal wave capture in a mesoscale strain field. Wave capture represents a generalization of critical layer events for flows lacking the spatial symmetry inherent in a parallel shear flow or isolated vortex.},

abstract = {AbstractUnderstanding and predicting how internal tides distort and lose coherence as they propagate through the ocean has been identified as a key issue for interpreting data from the upcoming wide-swath altimeter mission Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT). This study addresses the issue through the analysis of numerical experiments where a low-mode internal tide propagates through a quasigeostrophic turbulent jet. Equations of motion linearized around the slower turbulent field are projected onto vertical modes and assumed to describe the dynamics of the low-mode internal tide propagation. Diagnostics of the terms responsible for the interaction between the wave and the slow circulation are computed from the numerical outputs. The large-scale change of stratification, on top of eddies and jet meanders, contributes significantly to these interaction terms, which is shown to be consistent with an independent scaling analysis. The sensitivity of interaction terms to a degradation of the slow field spatial and temporal resolution indicates that present-day observing systems (Argo network, altimetry) may lack the spatial resolution necessary to correctly predict internal tide evolution. The upcoming SWOT satellite mission may improve upon this situation. The number of vertical modes required to properly estimate interaction terms is discussed. These results advocate development of a simplified model based on solving a modest number of the linearized equations subject to a prescribed mesoscale field and internal tide sources.},

abstract = {The role of mesoscale eddies in modulating the semidiurnal internal tide (SIT) in the northern South China Sea (SCS) is examined using the data from a cross-shaped mooring array. From November 2013 to January 2014, an anticyclonic eddy (AE) and cyclonic eddy (CE) pair crossed the westward SIT beam originating in Luzon Strait. Observations showed that, because of the current and stratification modulations by the eddy pair, the propagation speed of the mode-1 SIT sped up (slowed down) by up to 0.7 m s 21 (0.4 m s 21) within the AE's (CE's) southern portion. As a result of the spatially varying phase speed, the mode-1 SIT wave crest was clockwise rotated (counterclockwise rotated) within the AE (CE) core, while it exhibited convex and concave (concave and convex) patterns on the southern and northern peripheries of the AE (CE), respectively. In mid-to-late November, most of the mode-1 SIT energy was refracted by the AE away from Dongsha Island toward the north part of the northern SCS, which resulted in enhanced internal solitary waves (ISWs) there. Corresponding to the energy refraction, responses of the depth-integrated mode-1 SIT energy to the eddies were generally in phase at the along-beam-direction moorings but out of phase in the south and north parts of the northern SCS at the cross-beam-direction moorings. From late December to early January, intensified mode-2 SIT was observed, whose energy was likely transferred from the mode-1 SIT through eddy-wave interactions. The observation results reported here are helpful to improve the capability to predict internal tides and ISWs in the northern SCS.},

The observed flows are more energetic at the surface, but the shape of the kinetic energy spectra is independent of depth. These characteristics resemble predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The ratio of across-track to along-track kinetic energy spectra, however, significantly departs from the expectation of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence.

abstract = {Historical surface marine wind reports have been processed to define characteristic seasonal distributions of wind-stress curl over the four major eastern boundary current regions of the World Ocean (i.e., the California, Canary, Benguela, and Peru/Humboldt systems) on smaller scales than previously available. Interregional comparisons show that these “classical” coastal upwelling systems are characterized by cyclonic wind-stress curl near the continental boundaries and anticyclonic curl offshore, in association with predominantly equatorward (upwelling favorable) alongshore wind stress. The cross-shore profile of alongshore stress typically has an offshore maximum located some 200 to 300 km from the coast. The decay of the wind stress toward the coast defines a region of cyclonic wind-stress curl, where coastal upwelling is enhanced by curl-induced oceanic upwelling (Ekman pumping). During summer in the respective hemispheres, the region of cyclonic curl expands poleward in each boundary current system. Particularly intense cyclonic curl occurs adjacent to capes during summer coastal upwelling maxima. During fall and winter when the upwelling system weakens, the latitudinal extent of cyclonic curl adjacent to the coast contracts, and the moist intense cyclonic curl is usually associated with coastal bights.},

The response in SSP and longshore velocity is assumed to be dominated by the mode one wave. In every case, coherence squared between observed and modeled SSP is significant at the 95{\%} level over the entire low frequency band (≤0.2 cpd) with an average phase difference less than ±30°.

@article{Samelson2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Meteorological Society. A time-dependent, inviscid, linear theory for the generation of poleward undercurrent flow under upwelling conditions along midlatitude ocean eastern boundaries is proposed. The theory relies on a conceptual separation of time scales between the rapid, coastal-trapped wave response to upwelling winds and the subsequent slow, interior, quasigeostrophic evolution. Solutions are obtained under idealized conditions in which the coastal boundary and the continental-slope topography are uniform alongshore, and the time-dependent wind-stress forcing is applied over a limited meridional range, uniform cross-shore, and directed alongshore. A time-dependent coastal boundary condition on the slow-time-scale interior flow, consisting of the low-frequency, geostrophically balanced sea surface height disturbance over the outer shelf, is obtained from consideration of the fast-time-scale, coastal-trapped response. A quasigeostrophic potential vorticity equation is then solved to determine the interior response to this time-dependent boundary condition. Under upwelling conditions, the results show the formation of a localized region of subsurface poleward flow over the upper continental slope that is qualitatively consistent in amplitude, location, and timing with observations of poleward undercurrents on eastern boundaries. Despite its origin as a sea surface height anomaly, the coastal-boundary condition drives a baroclinic planetary wave response, in which the poleward subsurface flow evolves in planetary vorticity balance with induced subsurface upwelling.},

abstract = {Historically, researchers have developed large-scale Earth science applications , such as ocean and atmosphere models, under monolithic software-development practices, usually within a single institution. Over the past decade, an emphasis on integrated multicomponent modeling has emerged-reflecting an increase in scientific capabilities and computing capacity, and resulting in several ambitious, coupled, Earth system modeling efforts. In these coupled efforts, which span institutions and disciplines, the current monolithic software-development practices can seriously hamper continued innovation in complex , highly integrated simulations. Most notably, current practices hinder broad community sharing of software renditions of Earth system modeling algorithms. This affects both model-ing and innovation as well as the ability to effectively synthesize models with data assimilation. In the latter case, the increased volume and availability of rich observational data streams, especially from space-borne remote-sensing platforms, requires specialized data-assimilation software to rigorously combine models and data. The absence of technology and standards to let researchers share software results in redundant development and impairs technology transfer, which in turn impacts scientific progress. On the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) project, we are building standards-based open-source software that aims to increase software reuse, component interoperability, performance portability, and ease of use in Earth science applications. The project is a multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary collaboration that includes many of the largest Earth science modeling centers in the US; the NASA Computational Technologies Program is funding the initial three-year effort. In this article , we describe the ESMF's architecture, focusing on the features that enable it to be flexible enough to accommodate a wide and continually evolving suite of modeling tools. The Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) project is developing a standard software platform for Earth system models. The standard, which defines a component architecture and a support infrastructure, is being developed under open-software practices.

Both components are publicly available and highly integrated with the MITgcm. They are both subjected to regular, automated regression tests. The modeling framework includes sets of global conformal grids, a global model setup, implementations of model-data constraints and adjustable control parameters, an interface to algorithmic differentiation, as well as a grid-independent, fully capable Matlab toolbox. The reference ECCO v4 solution is a dynamically consistent ocean state estimate (ECCO-Production, release 1) without un-identified sources of heat and buoyancy, which any interested user will be able to reproduce accurately. The solution is an acceptable fit to most data and has been found physically plausible in many respects, as documented here and in related publications. Users are being provided with capabilities to assess model-data misfits for themselves. The synergy between modeling and data synthesis is asserted through the joint presentation of the modeling framework and the state estimate. In particular, the inverse estimate of parameterized physics was instrumental in improving the fit to the observed hydrography, and becomes an integral part of the ocean model setup available for general use. More generally, a first assessment of the relative importance of external, parametric and structural model errors is presented. Parametric and external model uncertainties appear to be of comparable importance and dominate over structural model uncertainty. The results generally underline the importance of including turbulent transport parameters in the inverse problem.},

In situ measurements of wind and ocean currents provide a detailed view of this phenomenon. By separating the wind-driven current from the measured total current and by averaging over a long record, it is found that the observed transport is consistent with theoretical Ekman transport to within about 10 percent.

Water in the ocean at all time and space scales is subject to the same small set of forces and accelerations. What distinguishes one type of motion from another, for instance a surface wave from the Gulf Stream, is the relative importance of the different accelerations and forces within this small set. Motion of water in the ocean is driven by the sun, the moon, or tectonic processes. The sun's energy is transferred to the ocean through buoyancy fluxes (heat fluxes and water vapor fluxes) and through the winds. Tides create internal waves that break, creating turbulence and mixing. Earthquakes and turbidity currents create random, irregular waves including tsunamis. Geothermal processes heat the water very gradually with little effect on circulation. Concepts of density evolution, mixing layers, and direct wind response are explained in the chapter. Wind-driven circulation models of the gyre circulations are described. Details of equatorial and eastern boundary circulations and thermohaline forcing are also presented in the chapter.},

The research helped to determine correlations between the parameters and components of the water environment (metals/metalloids, cations/anions, pH, Eh, conductivity, carbon (TOC, IC, TC), and suspension). The contents of metals and metalloids were determined with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), whereas anions and cations were investigated with ion chromatography (IC).

abstract = {We propose a deep learning method for single image super-resolution (SR). Our method directly learns an end-to-end mapping between the low/high-resolution images. The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the high-resolution one. We further show that traditional sparse-coding-based SR methods can also be viewed as a deep convolutional network. But unlike traditional methods that handle each component separately, our method jointly optimizes all layers. Our deep CNN has a lightweight structure, yet demonstrates state-of-the-art restoration quality, and achieves fast speed for practical on-line usage. We explore different network structures and parameter settings to achieve trade-offs between performance and speed. Moreover, we extend our network to cope with three color channels simultaneously, and show better overall reconstruction quality.},

abstract = {One impressive advantage of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is their ability to automatically learn feature representation from raw pixels, eliminating the need for hand-designed procedures. However, recent methods for single image super-resolution (SR) fail to maintain this advantage. They utilize CNNs in two decoupled steps, i.e., first upsampling the low resolution (LR) image to the high resolution (HR) size with hand-designed techniques (e.g., bicubic interpolation), and then applying CNNs on the upsampled LR image to reconstruct HR results. In this paper, we seek an alternative and propose a new image SR method, which jointly learns the feature extraction, upsampling and HR reconstruction modules, yielding a completely end-to-end trainable deep CNN. As opposed to existing approaches, the proposed method conducts upsampling in the latent feature space with filters that are optimized for the task of image SR. In addition, the HR reconstruction is performed in a multi-scale manner to simultaneously incorporate both short- and long-range contextual information, ensuring more accurate restoration of HR images. To facilitate network training, a new training approach is designed, which jointly trains the proposed deep network with a relatively shallow network, leading to faster convergence and more superior performance. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on widely adopted data sets and improves the performance of state-of-the-art methods with a considerable margin. Moreover, in-depth ablation studies are conducted to verify the contribution of different network designs to image SR, providing additional insights for future research.},

abstract = {A single image super-resolution (SR) algorithm that combines deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multi-scale similarity is presented in this work. The aim of this method is to address the incapability of the existing CNN methods in digging the potential information in the image itself. In order to dig these information, the image patches that look similar within the same scale and across the different scales are firstly searched inside the input image. Subsequently, a spatial transform networks (STNs) are embedded into the CNNs to make the similar patches well aligned. The STNs allow the CNNs to have the ability of spatial manipulation of data. Finally, when SR is performing through the proposed pyramid-shaped CNNs, the high-resolution (HR) image will be predicted gradually according to the complementary information provided by these aligned patches. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate it can be compared with state-of-the-art approaches for single image SR.},

abstract = {Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper con-volutional neural networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4× upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method.},

abstract = {A machine learning framework is developed to estimate ocean-wave conditions. By supervised training of machine learning models on many thousands of iterations of a physics-based wave model, accurate representations of significant wave heights and period can be used to predict ocean conditions. A model of Monterey Bay was used as the example test site; it was forced by measured wave conditions, ocean-current nowcasts, and reported winds. These input data along with model outputs of spatially variable wave heights and characteristic period were aggregated into supervised learning training and test data sets, which were supplied to machine learning models. These machine learning models replicated wave heights from the physics-based model with a root-mean-squared error of 9 cm and correctly identify over 90{\%} of the characteristic periods for the test-data sets. Impressively, transforming model inputs to outputs through matrix operations requires only a fraction ({\textless}1/1,000th) of the computation time compared to forecasting with the physics-based model.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature The California Current System (CCS) is an eastern boundary upwelling system characterized by strong eddies that are often generated at the coast. These eddies contribute to intense, long-distance cross-shelf transport of upwelled water with enhanced biological activity. However, the mechanisms of formation of such coastal eddies, and more importantly their capacity to trap and transport tracers, are poorly understood. Their unpredictability and strong dynamics leave us with an incomplete picture of the physical and biological processes at work, their effects on coastal export, lateral water exchange among eddies and their surrounding waters, and how long and how far these eddies remain coherent structures. Focusing our analysis on the southern part of the CCS, we find a predominance of cyclonic eddies, with a 25-km radius and a SSH amplitude of 6 cm. They are formed near shore and travel slightly northwest offshore for {\~{}} 190 days at {\~{}} 2 km day −1 . We then study one particular, representative cyclonic eddy using a combined Lagrangian and Eulerian numerical approach to characterize its kinematics. Formed near shore, this eddy trapped a core made up of {\~{}} 67{\%} California Current waters and {\~{}} 33{\%} California Undercurrent waters. This core was surrounded by other waters while the eddy detached from the coast, leaving the oldest waters at the eddy's core and the younger waters toward the edge. The eddy traveled several months as a coherent structure, with only limited lateral exchange within the eddy.},

abstract = {Two global ocean models ranging in horizontal resolution from 1/128 to 1/488 are used to study the space and time scales of sea surface height (SSH) signals associated with internal gravity waves (IGWs). Frequency-horizontal wavenumber SSH spectral densities are computed over seven regions of the world ocean from two simulations of the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and three simulations of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm). High wavenumber, high-frequency SSH variance follows the predicted IGW linear dispersion curves. The realism of high-frequency motions ({\textgreater}0:87 cpd) in the models is tested through comparison of the frequency spectral density of dynamic height variance computed from the highest-resolution runs of each model (1/258 HYCOM and 1/488 MITgcm) with dynamic height variance frequency spectral density computed from nine in situ profiling instruments. These high-frequency motions are of particular interest because of their contributions to the small-scale SSH variability that will be observed on a global scale in the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite altimetry mission. The variance at supertidal frequencies can be comparable to the tidal and low-frequency variance for high wavenumbers (length scales smaller than 50 km), especially in the higher-resolution simulations. In the highest-resolution simulations, the high-frequency variance can be greater than the low-frequency variance at these scales.},

abstract = {Abstract Oceanographic observations are limited by sampling rates, while ocean models are limited by finite resolution and high viscosity and diffusion coefficients. Therefore both data from observations and ocean models lack information at small- and fast-scales. Methods are needed to either extract information, extrapolate, or up-scale existing oceanographic datasets, to account for or represent unresolved physical processes. Here we use machine learning to leverage observations and model data by predicting unresolved turbulent processes and sub-surface flow fields. As a proof-of-concept, we train convolutional neural networks on degraded-data from a high-resolution quasi-geostrophic ocean model. We demonstrate that convolutional neural networks successfully replicate the spatio-temporal variability of the sub-grid eddy momentum forcing, are capable of generalising to a range of dynamical behaviours, and can be forced to respect global momentum conservation. The training data of our convolutional neural networks can be sub-sampled to 10-20{\%} of the original size without a significant decrease in accuracy. We also show that the sub-surface flow field can be predicted using only information at the surface (e.g., using only satellite altimetry data). Our study indicates that data-driven approaches can be exploited to predict both sub-grid and large-scale processes, while respecting physical principles, even when data is limited to a particular region or external forcing. Our in-depth study presents evidence for the successful design of ocean eddy parameterisations for implementation in coarse-resolution climate models.},

abstract = {The seasonal cycle of submesoscale flows in the upper ocean is investigated in an idealised model domain analogous to mid-latitude open ocean regions. Submesoscale processes become much stronger as the resolution is increased, though with limited evidence for convergence of the solutions. Frontogenetical processes increase horizontal buoyancy gradients when the mixed layer is shallow in summer, while overturning instabilities weaken the horizontal buoyancy gradients as the mixed layer deepens in winter. The horizontal wavenumber spectral slopes of surface temperature and velocity are steep in summer and then shallow in winter. This is consistent with stronger mixed layer instabilities developing as the mixed layer deepens and energising the submesoscale. The degree of geostrophic balance falls as the resolution is made finer, with evidence for stronger non-linear and high-frequency processes becoming more important as the mixed layer deepens. Ekman buoyancy fluxes can be much stronger than surface cooling and are locally dominant in setting the stratification and the potential vorticity at fronts, particularly in the early winter. Up to 30{\%} of the mixed layer volume in winter has negative potential vorticity and symmetric instability is predicted inside mesoscale eddies as well as in the frontal regions outside of the vortices.},

abstract = {Atmospheric phenomena such as the quasi-stationary Rossby waves, teleconnection patterns, ultralong persistent blockings and the polar/subtropical jet are characterized by planetary spatial scales, i.e. scales of the order of the earth's radius. This motivates our interest in the relevant physical processes acting on the planetary scales. Using an asymptotic approach, we systematically derive reduced model equations valid for atmospheric motions with planetary spatial scales and a temporal scale of the order of about 1 week. We assume variations of the background potential temperature comparable in magnitude with those adopted in the classical quasi-geostrophic theory. At leading order, the resulting equations include the planetary geostrophic balance. In order to apply these equations to the atmosphere, one has to prescribe a closure for the vertically averaged pressure. We present an evolution equation for this component of the pressure which was derived in a systematic way from the asymptotic analysis. Relative to the prognostic closures adopted in existing reduced-complexity planetary models, this new dynamical closure may provide for more realistic increased large-scale, long-time variability in future implementations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Aluie2017,
abstract = {A coarse-graining framework is implemented to analyze nonlinear processes, measure energy transfer rates and map out the energy pathways from simulated global ocean data. Traditional tools to measure the energy cascade from turbulence theory, such as spectral flux or spectral transfer rely on the assumption of statistical homogeneity, or at least a large separation between the scales of motion and the scales of statistical inhomogeneity. The coarse-graining framework allows for probing the fully nonlinear dynamics simultaneously in scale and in space, and is not restricted by those assumptions. This paper describes how the framework can be applied to ocean flows. Energy transfer between scales is not unique due to a gauge freedom. Here, it is argued that a Galilean invariant subfilter scale (SFS) flux is a suitable quantity to properly measure energy scale-transfer in the Ocean. It is shown that the SFS definition can yield answers that are qualitatively different from traditional measures that conflate spatial transport with the scale-transfer of energy. The paper presents geographic maps of the energy scale-transfer that are both local in space and allow quasi-spectral, or scale-by-scale, dynamics to be diagnosed. Utilizing a strongly eddying simulation of flow in the North Atlantic Ocean, it is found that an upscale energy transfer does not hold everywhere. Indeed certain regions, near the Gulf Stream and in the Equatorial Counter Current have a marked downscale transfer. Nevertheless, on average an upscale transfer is a reasonable mean description of the extra-tropical energy scale-transfer over regions of O(10{\^{}}3) kilometers in size.},

@article{Carr2003,
abstract = {High productivity (maxima ∼3 g C m-2 day-1) of the Eastern Boundary Currents (EBCs), i.e. the California, Peru- Humboldt, Canary and Benguela Currents, is driven by a combination of local forcing and large-scale circulation. The characteristics of the deep water brought to the surface by upwelling favorable winds depend on the large-scale circulation patterns. Here we use a new hydrographic and nutrient climatology together with satellite measurements of the wind vector, sea-surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll concentration, and primary production modeled from ocean color to quantify the meridional and seasonal patterns of upwelling dynamics and biological response. The unprecedented combination of data sets allows us to describe objectively the variability for small regions within each current and to characterize the governing factors for biological production. The temporal and spatial environmental variability was due in most regions to large-scale circulation, alone or in combination with offshore transport (local forcing). The observed meridional and seasonal patterns of biomass and primary production were most highly correlated to components representing large-scale circulation. The biomass sustained by a given nutrient concentration in the Atlantic EBCs was twice as large as that of the Pacific EBCs. This apparent greater efficiency may be due to availability of iron, physical retention, or differences in planktonic community structure. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Tomczak1981,
abstract = {The use of terms such as Benguela Current or Peru Current System for different features of the oceanic circulation in the eastern parts of the oceans is reviewed. During 50 years of upwelling research these terms have been used for different oceanographic phenomena. It is argued that one reason for inconsistent use has been that names of currents were chosen on geographic rather than hydrodynamic principles, and that although knowledge of the dynamics of current systems expanded, it became increasingly difficult to modify the existing nomenclature accordingly. In order to provide a basis for a unified terminology, the dynamics of ocean currents in the eastern pans of the oceans are reviewed. It is argued that the coastal upwelling current system is a modification of the inshore part of the eastern boundary current and consequently should not be named as opposed to it but as part of it. It is suggested that the traditional geographic names be used for the eastern boundary currents and new names be assigned by international agreement to the coastal upwelling currents. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

@article{Chavez2009,
abstract = {Coastal upwelling along eastern boundaries has fascinated oceanographers for decades. The strong coupling between atmospheric forcing, ocean circulation, biogeochemical cycling, and food web dynamics encouraged oceanographers to conduct multidisciplinary scientific studies that have since become common. Following that tradition, an interdisciplinary approach is taken to highlight differences between the major Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems (EBUE's). Ocean basin-scale settings are important determinants of EBUE characteristics. First, trade winds accumulate heat and mass in the western side of the basins, deepening the thermocline in the west and raising it in the east. Second, and especially prominent in the Pacific, these properties are redistributed eastwards on interannual and multidecadal time scales, reducing the characteristically high biological productivity found in the eastern basin margins. Thirdly, north-south patterns of thermocline doming on the equator and deepening in the subtropical gyres, and high latitude weather-driven mixing makes latitude an important characteristic of each EBUE. As such each EBUE has 3-4 well-defined latitudinally distributed biomes. Many enigmas remain regarding EBUE's including: (1) Why do EBUE's differ dramatically in fish but not in primary production? (2) What nutrients or other physical properties limit EBUE primary production? (3) What roles do subsurface oxygen minimum zones play in EBUE ecosystems? (4) What role do euphausiids play in the transfer of energy through EBUE food webs? (5) What are the roles of EBUE food webs in the biogeochemical cycling of elements? (6) How inter-connected are biomes of EBUE ecosystems? and (7) Most importantly for society, how will EBUE's respond to climate and global change. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Global 1° × 1° climatologies of the first baroclinic gravity-wave phase speed c1 and the Rossby radius of deformation $\gamma$1 are computed from climatological average temperature and salinity profiles. These new atlases are compared with previously published 5° × 5° coarse resolution maps of $\gamma$1 for the Northern Hemisphere and the South Atlantic and with a 1° × 1° fine-resolution map of c1 for the tropical Pacific. It is concluded that the methods used in these earlier estimates yield values that are biased systematically low by 5{\%}-15{\%} owing to seemingly minor computational errors. Geographical variations in the new high-resolution maps of c1 and $\gamma$1 are discussed in terms of a WKB approximation that elucidates the effects of earth rotation, stratification, and water depth on these quantities. It is shown that the effects of temporal variations of the stratification can be neglected in the estimation of c1 and $\gamma$1 at any particular location in the World Ocean. This is rationalized from consideration of the WKB approximation.},

abstract = {The seasonal variation of the physical characteristics and of large-scale current patterns of rhe California Current system is examined using harmonic analysis dpplied to the 23 yedrs of California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations data collected between 1950 and 1978. The amplitude and phasing of seasonal variation in dynamic height and the overall standard deviation of dynamic height define three domains: oceanic. coastal. and dn intervening transition zone. The trdnsition zone is a broad band centered approximately 2W300 km offshore and parallel to the coast in which the seasonal range of dynamic height is a relative minimum dnd the standard deviation is d maximum. It is hypothesized that recurrent mesoscale sddies and energetic meanders create this zone. Such eddies and meanders would contribute heavily to the standard deviation of dynamic height but not its seasonal variation. The transilion gone is coincident with the core of flow of the California Current. A strong interaction between the core of the Cdlifornia Current and the meso- scale eddy field is evidenr. Seasonal variation in !he fields of temperature. salinity, my, dnd oxygen is related to variations in the California Current. the Inshore Countercurrent and the California Undercurrent through vertical adjustments in the density field and through changes in [ransport.
